How To Play?

Guess a number between 1 and 20. For every wrong guess 1 point will be deducted from the default score 20. For every wrong attempt a message will tell you that whether your number is greater or lesser than the secret number. You will lose the game once the score becomes zero.

So let's have a play and see, can you get the number in first very attempt and have a 20!
